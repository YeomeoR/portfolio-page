        <h3>Behind the code</h3>
        <p>Formerly a classical violinist working with the London Symphony Orchestra and co-leader of Royal 
            Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, I'm adaptable, responsive, creative and with attention to fine detail.
            Web and software developing has always held a fascination for
            me and been a career that I would have liked to pursue, at some point. For the past 18 months, I 
            have taken time out of an honours degree course with the Open University in Mathematical Sciences and 
            Statistics to enable me to dedicate and structure my time to focus solely on this new career direction in code.

        <h3>Yeomeo</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rob. I have a Bachelors degree in Music, I've worked as a classical musician in Glasgow and London and travelled around the world with the finest orchestras, enjoying every minute of it... but I always had a eye on where my coding could take me. <br>I'm a hard working consumer of as much information as I can immerse myself in, and always have been. <br>I have a competitive streak that isn't confined to my enjoyment of racing triathlons... But a successful orchestral musician knows, it's teamwork that counts and I could be a valuable member of any team. I'm looking for a company to give me my chance to shine in this new career direction. 
            My GitHub page is <a href="https://github.com/YeomeoR" target="_blank">YeomeoR</a>. Or you could look at some of my projects
